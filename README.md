SQL tuning project for Advance Database Topic
SQL Server performance tuning contains a set of processes and procedures designed to optimize relational database queries to run as efficiently as possible. SQL tuning applies several elements, including identifying which queries are encountering slowdowns and optimizing them for maximum efficiency. As a result, numerous relational databases such as MySQL and SQL Server will benefit from SQL tuning.
Using proper indexes based on the table size and selecting appropriate fields as indexes has a significant impact on performance.

Workflow steps:
1.	Write a query
2.	Apply tunning principals
3.	Check the Execution plan
4.	Create a workload in SQL-Profiler
5.	Save the Workload as a trace-File 
6.	Crease a Session in Tunning-Advisor and assign the saved Trace file to it
7.	Run the Analysing section
8.	Check suggested Tunning advisers and apply them to the database
